Hi!\
This program is an exercise to practice passing and returning structs.\
It defines a `Fraction` struct with a numerator and a denominator. The program includes functions to get a fraction from the user, multiply two fractions, and print a fraction. The `main` function demonstrates the usage by getting two fractions from the user, multiplying them, and printing the result.
