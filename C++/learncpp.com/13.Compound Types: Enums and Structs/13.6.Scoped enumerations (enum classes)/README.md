Hi!\
This is another simple program, but it's a good exercise for practice.\
Also I'm really close to object oriented programing that I really love.\
This program is an exercise to practice using scoped enumerations (`enum class`).
It defines an `Animal` enum class with a list of animals. The program then includes functions to get the name and number of legs for a given animal. The `main` function demonstrates the usage by printing the details for a cat and a chicken.\
