We meet again mate!\
As stressful as OOP can be, it is just as fun.\
This exercise is about using constructor member initializer lists in C++.\
The program defines a `ball` class with color and radius properties. The constructor uses a member initializer list to efficiently initialize these properties when a `ball` object is created. The main function then creates two different `ball` objects and prints their details to the console to show that the initialization worked correctly.\
