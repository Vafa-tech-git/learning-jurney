Hi there!\
This program is an exercise to practice using delegating constructors.
It defines a `ball` class that has two constructors. One constructor delegates the initialization to another constructor. The program then creates several instances of the `ball` class to show how the delegating constructors work.\
It was fun to make, hope you enjoy it too!
