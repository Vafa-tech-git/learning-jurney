Hi!\
So, I've finally gotten to my favorite part of programming: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\
This program is an exercise to practice using classes with public and private members.
It defines a `Point3d` class that represents a point in 3D space. The program demonstrates creating instances of the class, setting their values, printing them, and comparing them for equality.
