# Fraction Calculator\

Hi there!\
This exercise demonstrates the use of classes in C++ by implementing a fraction calculator.\
The program defines a `Fraction` class that represents a mathematical fraction with a numerator and denominator.\
It shows how to:\
- Use private member variables to encapsulate data\
- Implement member functions for input, multiplication, and output\
- Work with const member functions\
- Handle object multiplication and chaining operations\

The program allows users to input two fractions and displays their multiplication result.
