# Triad (class template) — 15.5 Class templates with member functions\

This example demonstrates a class template `Triad` that stores three values of (possibly) different types.\
It shows:\
- template declaration and usage,\
- constructor with a member initializer list,\
- member function defined outside the class template,\
- simple getters, setters and a print helper.\

The program prints two example Triad instances: one with three ints and one mixing int, double and std::string.
