# Vector Sum and Product Calculator

This C++ program prompts the user to enter three integer values. It then calculates and displays the sum and product of these numbers. The program uses a `std::vector` to store the user's input.

## Example Usage

```
Give 3 integral values separated by a space: 2 3 4
The sum is: 9
The product is: 24
```

**Note:** 
The program is trivial, but it helps with understanding vectors.
I don't think it even needs comments to be understood.
