# Printer of an container element

This C++ program prints the value of the element of any container type.
The container it uses is `std::vector`.
It uses an `std::size_t` type for index so I don't need any conversion.

## Exemple usage

```
4 6 7 3 8 2 1
```

**Note:**
Again an trivial program but it helps understanding how vectors work with loops.
