# Vector Search and Index Reporting

This program demonstrates how to:
- Prompt the user for a number between 1 and 9 (with input validation)
- Search for that number in a vector of doubles
- Print the entire vector
- Report the index of the number if found, or indicate if it is not present

## How it works
1. The user is prompted to enter a number between 1 and 9. Invalid input is handled gracefully.
2. The program searches for the user's input in a predefined vector of doubles.
3. The vector is printed to the console.
4. The program prints the index of the found number, or a message if the number is not found.

## Example Output
```
Enter a number between 1 and 9: 7
4 6 7 3 8 2 1 9 4.4 6.6 7.7 3.3 8.8 2.2 1.1 9.9 
The number 7 has index 2
```
