# Range-based for loops

This program demonstrates how to:
- Use a range-based for loop to search for a name in a vector of string_view
- Prompt the user for input and check if the name exists in the list
- Output whether the name was found or not

## How it works
1. The user is prompted to enter a name.
2. The program searches for the name in a predefined vector using a template function and a range-based for loop.
3. The result is printed: either "found" or "not found".

## Example Output
```
Enter a name: Dave
Dave was found.
```
