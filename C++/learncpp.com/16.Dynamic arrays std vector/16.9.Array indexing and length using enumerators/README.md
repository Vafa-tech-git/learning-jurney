# Array Indexing and Length Using Enumerators

This program demonstrates how to:
- Use an enum to represent animal species
- Store the number of legs for each animal in a vector
- Use the enum values as indices to access vector elements
- Ensure the vector size matches the number of enum values

## How it works
1. An enum lists several animal species and a value representing the count.
2. A vector stores the number of legs for each animal, indexed by the enum.
3. The program prints the number of legs for the Elephant using the enum as an index.

## Example Output
```
An Elephant has 4 legs.
```

## Concepts Covered
- Enums for indexing
- Vectors
- Data validation with assertions
