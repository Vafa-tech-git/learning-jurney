Hi!\
Well forget about what I just said.\
It was fun to code it.\
Hope you enjoy it too!\
This one plays a little "FizzBuzz" style game.\  
It asks if you want to play (type "yes" to continue), then takes a whole number\ from the user and prints numbers from 1 up to that value.\  
For each number, it prints:\
- "fizzbuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5\
- "fizz" if divisible by 3 only\
- "buzz" if divisible by 5 only\
- "pop" if divisible by 7 only\
- Otherwise, it prints the number itself.\
